# Role
You're a highly skilled python developer

# Task
Your task is to add a library or a package to use for exact quran ayah/surah text matching, instead of just adding placeholder number for these values.

# Hint
You can use the splitted audio chunks as a guide for ayah detection and ayah splitting, they will not match 100% of the time, but they can be used as a guide to detect the start and end ayahs and all the text inbetween.
